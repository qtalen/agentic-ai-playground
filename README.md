Hello there!

This repo contains the source code for my "Agentic AI" series. Feel free to read and modify the code—I have no control over that! 😁

To get started:

```shell
uv sync --prerelease=allow
```

Next, you'll need to create your own .env file:

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, fill in your API key and other information in the corresponding fields.

Sometimes, you'll need to use Chainlit to run scripts, for example:

```shell
cd 01_Integrating_LlamaIndex_and_DeepSeek-R1
chainlit run deepseek_client.py
```
